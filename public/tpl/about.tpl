		<p>Hello, my name is Misha.</p>
		<p>As beginner in fishing, I would like to have a website I can find information about the best fishing places near me.</p>
		<p>As web-developer, I decided to create such a website, helping fishers around the world to exchange their knowledges and answering the question "where is the fish?" easily.</p>
		<p>The project is free: no ads, no payments, no "premiums". Enjoy!</p>
