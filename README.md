Where is Fish
=============

https://whereis.fish

Current version: **1.0.7**

As a beginner in fishing, I would like to have a website, where I can find information about the best fishing places near me.

As a web-developer, I decided to create such a website, using new for me technologies (self-made MEAN-stack + Google maps).

##### Stack of technologies being used:
- MongoDB
- Express
- Angular v.1.x
- Node.js
- Google Maps API
- Google Geocoding API
- reCAPTCHA

##### Roadmap:
- Spots filters (distance and rating)
- ~~Spot-url (shared link to Spot)~~
- ~~Localisation (EN, DE, RU)~~
- Page speed insights optimisation
- ~~Minify source for production~~
- Photos upload
- Popup as Angular-Service
- Decouple of Angular-Controllers
- Backend config-file
- ...
